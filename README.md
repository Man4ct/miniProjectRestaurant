This repository contains the code for a restaurant website project that I developed within a two-week timeframe. The goal of the project was to create a web application where users can browse the menu, place orders, and have an interactive experience with the restaurant. As an admin, there are additional features such as menu management and stock management.

## Challenges and Solutions
Throughout the development process, I encountered several challenges. From a technical perspective, I faced numerous errors and issues that required problem-solving skills. However, I approached these challenges with determination and a willingness to learn. By leveraging online resources, such as forums and Stack Overflow, I was able to find solutions and overcome these hurdles.

On the soft skill side, managing a team and maintaining effective communication proved to be a new challenge. Balancing clear goal-setting, expectation management, and fostering effective teamwork required careful consideration. By emphasizing a shared goal of creating an exceptional restaurant website, I ensured that everyone remained aligned and motivated.
